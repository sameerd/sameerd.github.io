A developmental trajectory describes the course of a behavior over age or time.
[Daniel Nagin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Nagin) pioneered a method
called `Group-based Trajectory Modeling` to `cluster` these trajectories into
groups. [Link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2994902/). This
method is quite popular in the medical and social sciences. In this post I will
take a look at his
[paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.119.8625&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
from 1999 - [Analyzing Developmental Trajectories - A Semiparametric
Group-based approach](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-03663-001) and provide
some code in `R` to work through the datasets.

## Datasets 
There are two interesting datasets associated with this paper. The first is
from the Cambridge study of Delinquint Development. It tracked 411 British
males from a working area of london. Data collection began in the early 60s
when the boys were 8 years old and continued till they were around 32. It
included criminal convictions and measured variables related to a number of
factors including psychological makeup, family circumstances, parenting
behavior and performance in school/work. <a title="By Diliff [CC BY-SA 3.0

The second dataset is a study of 1037 White males of French ancestry. This also
measures similar variables to the Cambridge study. 

We shall mainly focus on the Cambridge study. 

### Cambridge Study

```{r loaddata, message=FALSE}
library(foreign)
# read in the data
cambridge <- read.dta("https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/bjones/traj/data/cambrdge.dta")
```

This dataset has many columns and we can make some educated guesses about what is in them
* x01-x23 : Offense Counts (Number of offense counts in a year)
* x24-x46 : Unknown
* t1-t23 : Age
* tt1-tt23 : Scaled Age
* p1-p23 : Prevalence (Whether an offense was committed that year or not)
* y10 : ID
* other y's : Unknown (Probably covariates)

We will mainly be working with the Offense Counts but first let's convert this
dataset from wide to long. The `dplyr` toolset makes this easy. 

```{r cambridge, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)

# Convert Cambridge from wide to long format
# ID, TimeIdx (1-23), Age, Offense Count, Prevalence
# We drops the covariates and only keep the time series
cambridge_long <- cambridge %>%
  rename(ID=y10) %>%
  select(-starts_with("y")) %>% # drop covariates
  select(-starts_with("tt")) %>% # drop scaled age
  select(-(x24:x46)) %>% # drop unknown x variables
  gather(variable, value, -ID) %>%
  mutate(TimeIdx = parse_number(variable)) %>%
  mutate(variable = gsub("\\d", "", x=variable)) %>%
  spread(variable, value) %>%
  select(ID, TimeIdx, Age=t, Prevalence=p, OffCount=x) 

# A sampling of rows from the dataset
cambridge_long %>% slice(c(1:3, 20:23, 100:103, 7800:7804)) %>% print()
```

We look at the average number of offense counts by the boys ages and put some
confidence intervals around the mean.

```{r mean_off_count, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(cambridge_long, aes(Age, OffCount)) + 
  stat_summary(fun.y="mean", geom="line") +
  stat_summary(geom='ribbon', fun.data='mean_cl_boot', alpha=0.2) +
  labs(title="Mean Offense Count by Age", 
       y= "Mean Offense Count")
```

It looks like males commit alot of offenses in the mid/late teens compared to
the other years. 


## Fitting a Group-Based Trajectory model

```{r flexmix, message=FALSE}
library(flexmix)
set.seed(1)

num_components <- 3
ages <- 10:32

m <- flexmix(OffCount ~ Age + I(Age^2) | ID, k=num_components,
             model=FLXMRglm(family="poisson"),
             data=cambridge_long)
m
summary(m)
```

```{r flexmixpredictions}
cambridge_long$Cluster <- clusters(m)

GetAgeClusterPred <- function(age, k)  {
  p <- parameters(m, component=k)
  exp(p[1] + p[2] * age + p[3] * age^2)
}

predictions <- expand.grid(Age=ages, Cluster=1:num_components) %>% 
        rowwise() %>% mutate(OffCount=GetAgeClusterPred(Age, Cluster) )
```

```{r flexmixplot}
ggplot(cambridge_long, aes(Age, OffCount, color=factor(Cluster))) +
  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="line", alpha=0.8) + 
  geom_line(data=predictions, aes(color=factor(Cluster)), 
    linetype="dotted") +
  labs(y="Offense Count", 
    title="Trajectories of number of convictions (Cambridge Sample)")

```
