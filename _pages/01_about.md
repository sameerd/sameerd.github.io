This is a personal blog where I write about things that interest me in data
science, statistics and programming. Writing helps me to better understand what
I have learned. It also helps to connect me with people who have similar
interests.

I completed a Ph.D. in Mathematics in 2006 from the University of Chicago. My
thesis topic was in Algebraic Geometry - *The Trace of Frobenius for an
Ordinary Elliptic Curve*. Then I spent nearly 10 years as a quant researcher /
trader in finance. At my most recent job I was a data scientist at a large
academic hospital in the Chicago region. 

I have a passion for applying statistics and algorithms to get insights from
data. It is quite beautiful to see noisy data transformed into something
meaningful.
